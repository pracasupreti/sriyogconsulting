              Technology has been connecting everyone from one corner of the
              globe to another corner in the very fastest way. Businesses and
              almost all organisations need to have their proper digital
              presence in a very effective way and their main motive is to beat
              the competition and stay ahead.
              <br />
              <br />
              My journey into the realm of technology began over a decade ago
              when I founded my first IT startup in 2007 A.D. as PRACAS Infosys
              in Biratnagar. Recognizing the potential of technology to bridge
              gaps and catalyze progress, I always tried to embark on a mission
              to leverage digital solutions to address local challenges and
              foster economic development.

                <p className="col-span-3">
                  My vision was not merely to create successful businesses but
                  to effect meaningful change in my community where I have
                  contributed in more than 500 clients in my entire career
                  spreading 15 countries in the world, developing their website,
                  optimizing search results, developing mobile applications,
                  managing social media, growing their digital presence,

                  solutions and also providing dedicated Information Technology
                  Consulting Solution.
