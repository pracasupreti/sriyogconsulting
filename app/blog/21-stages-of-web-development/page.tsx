        <p>
          Websites play a crucial role in every business growth. It is the front
          face of every business organization or any product brand or services
          around the globe. Having a website makes a business cross the
          boundaries and can cater its products, services or brand image
          globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Companies find and hire different designers and developers, according
          to their requirement, but the thing is when they lack finding a
          developer their dream business is crashed. We have been seeing lots of
          websites where people used to keep mostly Lorem Ipsum kind of things,
          dummy, images, broken links, and many other information which are
          missing and are not relevant to the company which makes their
          reputation very bad in the cybersphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are different technology to make website and company chooses
          different developers, having expertise in multiple languages, and
          according to the expertise or experience of that developer, they used
          to choose the stack for developing the website rather than analyzing
          the need of their clients and at the other end, the company which is
          looking for making a website can’t make a good decision to make a good
          website because of the huge differences on the price of the Developer
          or the budget of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          It really matters to represent the brand, identity, and the reputation
          of the organization in the digital race. To stand ahead in the
          competition, digital branding helps and makes growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been seeing lots of companies and their websites ranking in
          the top of many search engines, but lack the proper presence due to
          not embracing many crucial factors: plug-ins, components, and other
          protocols which are more than 50 for making any website great.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s elaborate the major 21 stages of effective website development
          in 2025-2030
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold"> 1. Competitor analysis</p>
        <p>
          We are running a business, and the business always has competition
          with the similar products, brands or services offered by a wide range
          of service providers. To make a good website and stand ahead in the
          competition, it is necessary to analyze the competition with the
          products and services of the competitor company.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">2. Requirement analysis</p>
        <p>
          While making a website, it is good to have all the requirements
          analyzed earlier to give a proper shape, design, color theory, search
          engine optimization, typography, website visualization presentation,
          hit maps, loading speed, or hosting location, latency, security of the
          server, clean codes and many other things.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">3. Site map designing</p>
        <p>
          After analyzing the requirements, the site map should be designed in
          the proper way to make Website explode by a specific audience. Well,
          it varies with a user who browses the website, the pages, information,
          time to read the base, navigate to another base, etc.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">4. URL slug management</p>
        <p>
          Slug management directly affects the source engine optimization of any
          website. It should be clean, matching the title of the website,
          keeping-in between the awards, relevant to the words people used to
          search in Google or any other search engine.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">5. Layout sketch</p>
        <p>
          After creating the slug and site map, the states we need to follow are
          loud which can be drawn in plain paper, wireframing, tools, like
          Sigma, adobe, XD, Mero, balsamic etc.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full md:h-[450px] h-[250px] rounded-3xl overflow-hidden ">
          <Image
            src="/assets/images/homepage/blog/webiste-designing.png"
            alt="website-layout-design"
            className="object-cover h-full w-full"
            fill
          />
        </div>

        <p className="font-extrabold"> 6. Content creation</p>
        <p>
          It is said that “Content is King” and having proper content makes a
          website more informative, optimizes in Google and other search
          engines, etc.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">7. Page management</p>
        <p>
          Page management helps to manage the progress of the development phase
          of the website where Name, page slug, progress, content, photography
          and other things can be managed in the page management section where
          it helps to monitor the development phases and can be directed to the
          team.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">8. SEO content writing</p>
        <p>
          SEO content writing can trim, enhance, move proper takes from one page
          to another or make users interactive to read the page and also it
          makes the search engine understand the base and can make site links on
          Google and other service results. This practice makes a website
          friendly with search engines.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">9. UI/UX design designing</p>
        <p>
          After creating all contents, site maps and other things for the
          development phase. We need to follow the layout design and create an
          interface and user experience converting those sketches to wire frame,
          prototype and finally mock ups, so this can be easily understandable
          by front and developers.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">10. Photography management</p>
        <p>
          Website is a mixture of textual content, some videos, audio files as
          well as photography. These are the most important factors to make a
          website based and give the visual experience to the users. It should
          be real photos of the company, brand or services rather than any
          pictures found on social media, Google search or anywhere. Having
          realistic photos gives the real presence of the company.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">11. Front end Programming</p>
        <p>
          Developers need proper guidance to make a great website, after
          crossing a few steps like site map, wireframing to prototypes and
          mockups this helps developers to better understand to make the final
          product. Based on the requirements for making a website and after
          developing the website and releasing it on the Internet, we need to
          understand and adapt any frameworks or languages to make the website.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full md:h-[450px] h-[250px] rounded-3xl overflow-hidden ">
          <Image
            src="/assets/images/homepage/blog/front-end.png"
            alt="front-end"
            className="object-cover h-full w-full"
            fill
          />
        </div>
        <p className="font-extrabold"> 12. Quality Assurance</p>
        <p>
          After being developed, the front end, or we can say the starting site
          should be properly quality assured. The link should be checked, file
          naming system, local to remote link , meta description, file size,
          file format, resolution, and the file size of the website must be
          checked under this phase.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">13. Deployment</p>
        <p>
          Depending on the requirements, deployment can be made on various web
          servers around the globe. If a company is in one corner of the globe
          and targeting its audience in another corner of the globe, they should
          have their web server located in that other corner of the globe rather
          than hosting their website in their own location.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phase can be extended to the database, CMS, JAMStack technology,
          headless, CMS or any other mechanism to make a website more inactive
          at CMS and manage the website easily by any users or to make it
          dynamic or simply we can say it can be managed by anyone. Those who
          are not having programming skills for making this kind of thing need
          to add a few more technologies where the website can fetch information
          from its database or API or get results from a rendering server.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Making a great website is not an art but it is an expertise,
          experience and execution in the proper manner.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          We can say this is the second stage of website development is the
          website is going to be dynamic rather than the static one. We can have
          any static website for our company, which is updated only once in a
          month or we don’t have any dynamic content or we don’t want to update
          it regularly or a small budget website can be a static one, but for a
          organization who is looking for regular updates maintenance and
          managed by their own staff should have dynamic content or we can say
          CMS based website.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">14. Database designing</p>
        <p>
          In this regard, we need to make the database the updating system or
          the content we used to regularly update, delete, add, or modify from
          our website. In database designing, we create tables according to the
          pages of the website, login credentials, forget password links, new
          user signup, content management, photographs etc.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">15. API planning</p>
        <p>
          If we are making a website using JAM stack or headless CMS technology,
          we can have an API which directly fetches data from the data sources
          and makes the website easy to manage by a simple CMS technology rather
          than having heavy stuff or unnecessary bunch of codes.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full md:h-[450px] h-[250px] rounded-3xl overflow-hidden ">
          <Image
            src="/assets/images/homepage/blog/API.png"
            alt="API"
            className="object-cover h-full w-full"
            fill
          />
        </div>
        <p className="font-extrabold">16. Backend management</p>
        <p>
          To manage the website, create new pages, post update the content,
          change photos and to do various other things and websites it is needed
          to manage the backend.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">17. CMS development</p>
        <p>
          Based on the requirement, simplicity and requirements of web hosting
          server need to make our on CMS, use existing CMS or also we can choose
          any prebuilt framework like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Laravel and
          other pre built CMS or it’s always better to make on CMS based on our
          minimum requirement rather than keeping lots of bulky quotes and
          unnecessary plug-ins, which makes Website load very slower and can
          have security issue.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">18. Plug-ins and component management</p>
        <p>
          A great website can have great plug-ins, components and embedded
          codes, according to the requirement of the visitor where we can keep
          any boat chat option Google Maps, YouTube videos, Spotify music or
          direct calling from the website to the company or third-party forms.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">19. QA</p>
        <p>
          After having all the things covered, managed and developed for the
          best website, we need to have a proper quality assurance before
          upgrading the website on the Internet, so this phase can be a double
          checking system that we have done earlier in our static website.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full md:h-[450px] h-[250px] rounded-3xl overflow-hidden ">
          <Image
            src="/assets/images/homepage/blog/QA.jpeg"
            alt="QA"
            className="object-cover h-full w-full"
            fill
          />
        </div>
        <p className="font-extrabold">20. Domain name mapping</p>
        <p>
          After deploying a website on the server, we can check it in any
          third-party system or sometimes we need to have our own domain only
          for testing purposes, but to make a website live and easy to
          understand by the public. We should have domain name and it is
          necessary to map the dominium using Name server, A records or AAAA
          records.
        </p>
        <p className="font-extrabold">21. Release</p>
        <p>
          After completing all the stages, we need to release the website with
          our team. We can share it in our social media share with stakeholders,
          clients or communities. This is the final stage of Website
          development.
