          Flashback of just two decades in Nepal, it was hard to see people
          carrying bar phones. The dream of people was not a smart phone but
          basic one. NOKIA, Ericsson, Sony etc were market leader and the most
          important factor was a basic connectivity, upgrading from pager. GSM
          network was not much penetrated and the phones which values USD 15 at
          current dates were much valued just for voice and text.

          or phone with mobility synonym as Mobile phone and till now most of
          the people still call as "Mobile" which uses cellular network and its
          full name is "Mobile Phone or Cell Phone"

          Time increased and technology was emerging, the luxury phone became
          necessity day by day and it increased its presence and till date we
          have wide ranges of options to upgrade from basic bar phone with
          minimal features to high end, secured, sophisticated phone which are
          difficult to fit in the pocket{" "}
