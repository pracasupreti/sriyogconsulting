                      <p>Keyword research is one of the most important steps in any SEO strategy. If you don’t know what your audience is searching for, you won’t be able to create content that meets their needs. Good keyword research helps you discover the terms and questions people type into Google. Then, you can create content around those terms, which increases your chances of showing up in search results. In this blog, we’ll walk through a simple step-by-step guide for keyword research that works even if you’re a complete beginner.
</p>
                    <p>
                      Start by thinking like your customer. What would someone type into Google if they were looking for your product or service? Make a list of ideas. For example, if you sell herbal tea, think of words like “best herbal tea,” “green tea for stress,” “natural tea benefits,” or “tea for sleep.” Write down as many ideas as you can. These are called **seed keywords**, and they’re the foundation for your research.

                    </p>
                      <div className="relative w-full md:h-[450px] h-[250px] rounded-3xl overflow-hidden ">
                        <Image
                          src="/assets/images/blog/SEO-3.1.jpg"
                          alt="things-to-keep-in-website"
                          className="object-cover h-full w-full"
                          fill
                        />
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        Next, use keyword tools to expand your list. Tools like **Google Keyword Planner**, **Ubersuggest**, **AnswerThePublic**, and **Ahrefs** can help you find related keywords, search volume, and keyword difficulty. Look for keywords that have a good number of searches but not too much competition. These are known as **long-tail keywords**. For example, “organic green tea in Nepal” is more specific and easier to rank for than just “green tea.”

                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Once you have a list of keywords, choose the ones that are most relevant to your business. Don’t try to use every keyword on every page. Instead, pick one **main keyword per page** and use a few **related keywords** naturally throughout your content. Place your main keyword in the page title, the first paragraph, a heading, and the meta description. Use related keywords in other parts of the text. Don’t overuse any keyword, or it will hurt your SEO.

                      </p>
                      <div className="relative w-full md:h-[450px] h-[250px] rounded-3xl overflow-hidden ">
                        <Image
                          src="/assets/images/blog/SEO-3.2.jpg"
                          alt="things-to-keep-in-website"
                          className="object-cover h-full w-full"
                          fill
                        />
                      </div>
                        <p>Another smart idea is to look at what your competitors are doing. Search for your target keyword on Google and check the top 5 results. What are they writing about? What kind of content do they offer — blog posts, product pages, or videos? You can learn a lot from their content. Your goal should be to create something even better — more detailed, more useful, or easier to understand. This is called **content gap analysis**, and it helps you stand out.

                          src="/assets/images/blog/SEO-3.3.jpg"
                          alt="things-to-keep-in-website"
                          className="object-cover h-full w-full"
                          fill
                        />
                      </div>
<p>
  In conclusion, keyword research is the heart of SEO. Without it, you’re just guessing what people want. With it, you can create content that people are actually searching for, leading to more traffic, more clicks, and more success. It takes time to master, but even with simple tools and clear thinking, anyone can start doing effective keyword research today.
