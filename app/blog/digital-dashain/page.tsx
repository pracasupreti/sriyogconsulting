          People bless with words, gifts and majorly money is given with blessings. A new bill of 100 has more value than the old bill of 100 for everyone. It is also said and experienced that the note should make sound of being strong, like new and the happiest moment is getting unexpected amount of new currencies which sometimes seems like a jackpot.

The things repeat when the bills do not long last due to improper placement, writing, making dirt which are the pain points for NRB even after ban of stitching.

          <span className="font-[900]">Practicing FinTech:</span> Government should promote Digital Payment system &amp; Dashain is the very right time to implement it. Rather than wasting lots of millions on printing new bills, it will be great initiation and new practice to move people towards Digital Payment System like eSewa, Khalti, IME Pay or any Digital Payment Gateway alternatively. Practicing new things may take time but the proper vision must be made for future too. It&#39;s been decades that the major restaurants, hotel, shopping center have been accepting card payment i.e. Point of Sales (POS) in their premises. Now it&#39;s quite easy to carry cash in digital format. Years have been crossed where we had to carry cash. The time is cashless, hassle-less and fast. Credit card is offering buy now and pay later, schemes for EMI, certain percentage of cash back, special offers and more methodologies of growth hacking which directly increases the sales of any brand/product. Most of the all banks now have mobile-based apps both for Android and iOS which eases fund transfer, statement details, pay utility bills and more facilities are added time by time. Nepal Clearing House Ltd. which has started connectIPS has 80 banks including commercial banks, development banks and finance companies till now in its network. The process is easy which helps fund transfers or biller payments through single payment platform.

          The FinTech practice has been implemented in many different ways since a short time. It can be said that major 3 have brought revolution in Nepal on FinTech. In one hand NRB is promoting FinTech and other hand it has been investing billions of rupees for printing new notes. Practicing digital payment (digital dakshina) can be very fruitful option even for government in spite of burning billions to replace bills yearly and more the way when a child is blessed her practice can help her parents to implement future of FinTech in present time.

          The perfect timing of Dashain can be the best time to follow or start something new which helps to grow the users, make new practice, moving towards technology friendlier way of keeping money in cloud. Same can be used for more festivals which will automatically add one more user in every transaction. When a brother gifts his sister he can teach her to use the system, the latest technology. The practice can help her to avoid standing in queue for paying electricity bill, water bill or the process can be in few clicks to buy airline tickets or fund transfer later. The practice started in Dashain can be very useful for all the hassles of payments, the power of FinTech in smartphone, the way of simplifying transaction, saving precious time, maintaining all records of expenses.
          <br />
          <br />
          From the early sunshine to dark dawn, a man can pay for breakfast in any restaurant, pay for fuel, buy food, transfer to his son, buy a movie ticket. The whole process can be digitalized to cloud currency i.e. cashless payment system, where digits transfer in binary which is equivalent to cash in hand. It can also help to monitor cash flows, income, expenses in categories, a complete financial statistic graphically.
          <br />
          <br />
          Festivals like Dashain with families, Tihar with Dheusi/Bhaili &amp; Bhai Tika, Mother's Day, Father's Day, birthday gifts, balance transfer in phone, gifts, flight tickets, utilities bill payment, online shopping, ordering food online, pizza delivery, payment for services like plumbing, carpentry, gas delivery and hiring a photographer can be easily paid by Khalti, eSewa, IME Pay etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lack of operation knowledge, security and old mindsets, the industry needs to struggle upscaling mindsets to show the future technology. The best option can be sharing information, tutorial videos, toll-free 24x7 multilingual call centers, demo account &amp; more — some good rules and regulations by NRB to implement it. May it be trouble in early stage but a person can check his expenses, payments, remain, income and almost every data which he even needs after 20 years. The desired information safely stored in cloud.
