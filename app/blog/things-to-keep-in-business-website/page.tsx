        </p>
        <p>Key characteristics of a website include:</p>
        <p>
          1. Web Pages: Websites consist of individual web pages, each
          containing text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements. These
          pages are interconnected through links.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Domain Name: Websites are typically identified by a unique domain
          name (e.g., www.example.com), which serves as the web address for
          accessing the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Navigation: Websites use menus, links, and navigation bars to help
          users move between different web pages and sections of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Content: Websites contain content tailored to their purpose, which
          can include text articles, product listings, images, videos, audio
          files, and interactive elements.

          forms, search functionality, comment sections, and e-commerce
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Design and Layout: The visual design and layout of a website are

          7. Functionality: Websites can have various functions, such as
          e-commerce (online shopping), information sharing, social networking,

        <p>
