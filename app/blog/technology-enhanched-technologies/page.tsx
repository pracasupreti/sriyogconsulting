          &apos;Buy one get one free.&apos; An oldest but still running concept
          to double your sales in single transaction. When Sabeer Bhatia of
          Hotmail started free web based email service, his team started placing
          auto signature as “Create Free Email account” which helps to get more
          signups day by day later on Hotmail was acquired by Microsoft in USD
          400 million. It is about attracting customers towards any product,
          service, brand or something which enhances the sales. It is also about
          how you change the way people buy your products. It is almost in
          everything but very few people notices about it. The biggest example
          maybe The Mercedes Benz&nbsp;s logo which many other automobile
          companies applied later on. The Big STAR. The lighting Apple logo in
          Mac. There are many things like the Apple&nbsp;s and the Alienware
          logo which also falls under this.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is one of the most attracting feature of growth hacking as it is
          pretty catchy and people are often attracted towards these kinds of
          offers. Even if we walk on the street and don&nbsp;t notice anything
          but it&nbsp;s certain that our eye will sure catch these kinds of
          offers. Customers are often attracted to schemes that may seem like a
          good deal like the 50% discount offers to the buy one get one free
          ones.

          owner may not be able to trace back the data, conversations, contacts
          from his mails and in another hand when the employee leaves his email
          to his leaving organization he has to hand over his personal data,
          browsing history, photo backups, data stored in Google Drive, his core
          information saved in Google Password and more his various system
          connected or verified with email while his subscription in any

          Branding an organization using technology or without using technology
          but to effect marketing. In today&nbsp;s world; It is all about
          digital influence and marketing it through over the internet but few
          things still remains offline. There are many organizations
          &#40;Worldlink, NIC Aisa Bank, NTC etc&#41; hoarding boards and
          digital boards hanging all over the streets, pen stand, flyers,
          pamphlets, diaries, greeting cards which is one of the way to
          advertise it to the public and sometime it is necessary to play an
          advertisement of Coca Cola in heavy, about a certain product. Another
          example would be that a certain man came up with an idea of using
          solar power to light up the advertisements that we can see on
          expressways and highways.

          In today&nbsp;s world a product won&nbsp;t sell until and unless some
          brandings and advertisements are done. Why do we even use Pepsodent
          and Colgate when there are various other companies! It is all because
          the way they present themselves to the world. Marketing is the one of
          the biggest things to sell products, make brands in this world to sell
          your products to a huge numbers of people.

          It is mainly about training and setting up a routine for ourselves
          about our own self growth and Development. One of the most important
          things to setup a habit of working over certain ideas. Enhancing
          skills of employees to perform better.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is basically about listing the things that one would want to work
          over it again and again to ensure one&nbsp;s self growth and
          development. It&nbsp;s like an army training period that goes everyday
          without a question.

          It is necessary to adapt something which is being upgrading in the
          world rapidly on information technology industry and to ensure that we
          get updated to it we ourselves need to change. The course & curriculum
          accordingly to the growing world to stay updated is updating &
          investing for future. Avoiding this will certainly lag behind the
          rapid growing world of Information Technology which is the future.

          Data digitalization is all about creating a database of hardcopies
          over a certain digital platform. In our country this is the future;
          since our government has still been using paper works in few
          ministries & departments and keeping records of various subjects on a
          file. It can basically be like integrating data in a database and
          keeping various records of it. In the future it is going to be
          precious & important things since the country which has the kept the
          highest number of record may be the next Superpower or the Supreme
          Country. The more difficult part of practice is getting copy of
          citizenship, driving license and any records were all written on a
          file instead of using a Database and maintaining it regularly to keep
          it updated. Keeping data on digital format helps to find, share,
          manage, backup easily and there are various examples of this term
          which few government agencies & corporate has been practicing from
          years. Still many things are done using paper works instead of using a
          platform and that is also one of the reasons.

          Many data&nbsp;s around the world are being stolen from us anonymously
          without even our knowledge like the Face App which was claimed to have
          stolen various peoples information without even their knowing which
          can be dangerous as they can know everything about that particular
          person, so to control it data prevention is necessary so that users
          can feel safe about themselves. To insecure that the data is being
          kept safe, data preservation is needed.

          Google Earth can be a very good example of software to analyze data as
          it analyzes the searches made by the users and navigates them to the
          place that they search upon. Many applications are on the mobile phone
          nowadays that scans the documents which saves the time as like the old
          days; people won&nbsp;t have to go to Scanner Machines to scan their
          documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many countries via various applications have already started to gather
          the data of people around the world. As data is the biggest thing in
          this world and the more number of access of data you have the more you
          reach out. Many institutions & agencies collects data using various
          signup forms to create leads which they plan to convert into
          customers. In general; &apos;<b>Data is the new currency</b>&apos;.
          When a system, software, web or a mobile phone application accesses a
          lot of people&nbsp;s information regarding their location, phone
          number, contacts, storage etc.
