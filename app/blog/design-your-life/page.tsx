          We have always seen that fish mostly lies in two places, i.e. River and Aquarium. A fish living in aquarium has regular food, well maintained (artificial) temperature, adequate light and fancy place where the another fish lives in river, can freely move anywhere, search for food, has freedom and risk too. The same thing goes for a human life, when the life is not designed properly then someone who is electronics engineer will start selling vegetable in the road to prove his passion and becomes a great example mistakenly; so it is necessary to plan, sketch, design and build the life from early stage.

          <b>The “How to become RICH?” books certainly never makes a person rich instantly.</b> The rule of 16-60 which has been defined in such way that it designs the life of everyone, either he or she is student or a parent who are worried about their child future and in another hand the student is panic about his Career and life. This confusion comes in the conscious and sometimes in subconscious mind where anyone figures a successful person and wants to follow his/her path. Following a successful person is good thing but it may not give good future on someone’s future after 10-15 years. The struggle, plan, pains and other major factors which impacts directly to someone’s life is quite different in country, zone, area and subject which someone choose.

          Let's assume a boy was born in 2000 AD, his journey starts and he completes his SEE (10th grade examination in Nepal- Formerly SLC) in 2016, now the real story begins about 16-60 theory. This has been classified in 7 categories, i.e. childhood (till class ten) 3-16 years of age, Plus Two (K12) 16-18, Bachelor's Degree (18-22) where someone can finish his/her graduation, Experience 22-25 either master’s degree or any job experience, Career Growth (25-40), Sell your experience (40-60) and after that someone can do social service or roam the whole world or live life happily.

          <br />
          S/he chooses any subject in 2016 for plus two and completes in 2018, in the two years of educational journey he finishes plus two, this must be selected wisely. The same plus two will guide him his bachelor degree which is from 2018-2022, in 4 years he completes his graduation and from 2022-2025 he either does job/starts any business, joins Masters or starts a startup. The 3 years (22-25) will be his or her warm up period where they learn how to lead life, what things will boom in future and moreover all about the money, income, happy life and success.

          When planning your future, you must be focused in your study majorly after 10 class. If the parents have brainwashed/ guided any child since their early stage then they can manage them to study as they want like some parents have dream to make their child a doctor, but not in every case this happens. It is purely the choice of the student either he wants to choose the subject himself or he is forced to choose or he is waiting his friend’s approval.

          Life must have plan to overcome all the problems, pains and it must have a proper plan which is listed below. Now coming to the main scenario; A person starts his career (not late in 23rd of his/her age) somehow we say 25th, he works, runs a business till his 40, the experience in the same field will be 15 running years, if he or she works by heart then the experience could count as 30 years (virtually).
          <br />
          <br />
          The 15 running years of experience is enough to turn any stone into gem, the research, dedication, hard work, the sweat and blood makes anyone very perfect in his field. The 15 years working experience will start the journey of 40-60, this will make him talent and that 15 will give him more opportunities, customer, ideas, innovation, social network, a good team player and more. Life doesn't end on 60, now society waits for you, you can be Investor, seed funder, part of any social organization and lead a very better life.
