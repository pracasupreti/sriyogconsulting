                At SRIYOG Consulting, our mission is to harness the power of
                technology to drive impactful change across sectors that are
                fundamental to the growth of our society—healthcare, employment,
                and tourism. <br />
                <br />
                As someone who has spent over a decade navigating the
                intersection of innovation and social responsibility, I firmly
                believe in technology’s ability to unlock new opportunities and
                create a more sustainable, efficient, and connected world. My
                journey began in Biratnagar, Nepal, with a vision to use digital
                solutions to address local challenges, improve lives, and
                accelerate economic growth. From those early days with PRACAS
                Infosys to the establishment of SRIYOG Consulting, I’ve been
                driven by the idea that technology can be a force for good.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, we are empowering industries to transform digitally,
                whether it’s streamlining agricultural processes, creating
                innovative platforms for employment, or enhancing tourism
                experiences. Our tailored solutions help organizations in these
                sectors optimize their operations, expand their reach, and adapt
                to the rapidly changing digital landscape.
                <br />
                <br />
                We’re committed to building smarter, more resilient systems that
                not only meet the needs of today but also prepare our clients
                for the challenges of tomorrow. Together, we’re shaping the
                future of agriculture, employment, and tourism through the power
                of technology.
