          People worked for vision not to change the society but to make a Digital Empire to print money, create opportunities and inject few things which disrupted an industry but not the thoughts and even feelings.

          &quot;Zero (0) too has value if it stands after 1 to 9, if it&#39;s alone it always becomes a big ZERO.&quot;

          A business must be bounded by feelings, emotions and thoughts to change a society. We created thousands to billion dollars of empire, business, startups and a system where people can simply earn from few clicks in his/her smartphones. The use of technology has been in rapid growth stage that there are thousands of ways to earn, learn and lead the life easily. Technology has helped in many ways to get connected, either it is to become personal, professional or social. Thousands of Mobile Applications, different platforms, Gigabytes of storages and many megapixels of front and back camera.

          Airbnb started with a simple idea to share their homes, unused spaces, an airbed and hence a billion dollar business. A true statement says that &quot;Thousands of mile journey starts with a first step&quot; where they themselves tried, where the idea was in mind, a simple thing, available resources and the simple website based on WordPress. Focused for International&#39;s Design Conference in 2007, Brian Chesky and his co-founder Joe Gebbia started renting their apartment with Air-Mattress which is now a billion dollar business. The design conference which was held in October 2007 overcrowded city hotels so they saw the opportunity to start and solve something.

          Airbnb founders Joe Gebbia, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Brian Chesky. <br /><br />
          The company now has moved very far ahead of HomeAway, VRBO etc. Crossing different and difficult turns, now it has kept its name on the top of the home sharing business. The early stage was difficult where they e-mailed design blog and conference organizers asking them to help promote their website, which they supported. <br /><br />
          It was hard to let strangers stay and allocate their own rooms, but things went smoothly as people had to trust only by seeing a profile and some registered and recorded information.{" "}
          <span className="font-[900]">Technology helps to build better technology</span>. So Airbnb did just that—establishing and implementing new ideas, verification systems, beautiful photography, user-friendly UI, and more. They once said people would read a book about Airbnb—and now we are. They even listed companies whose cultures they wanted to emulate.

          In 2013, Airbnb introduced the ID Verification system which enhanced identity checks for both hosts and guests. The company built behavioral models and used machine learning to develop risk-detection tools that analyze reservations. <br /><br />

          Paris, Barcelona, and Santa Monica, CA have some of the strictest policies on who can and can&#39;t rent through Airbnb, while Amsterdam, Berlin, London, San Francisco, and New York have looser rules. Though Airbnb is a billion-dollar company trusted by millions, it is banned in many cities and buildings. Beyond location bans, Airbnb also reviews and suspends host accounts for violating rules—such as operating multiple accounts, poor ratings, or breaching terms of service.
