                    <p>The man behind Business Model Canvas was initially proposed by Alexander Osterwalder based on his business model ontology. Which has nine business modelling blocks. A business wants to be more great business, Jeff Bezos wants to earn more and more. A student wants to become a businessman.</p>

                    <p>
                      Business Model Canvas is used by well-established business to expand or scale where lean canvas model is used by startups to launch their products. No matters either it is for billion-dollar business of 100 dollar startup, the thousand miles of journey starts with the first step where travelling from lean canvas to business model canvas will result the brighter sunshine.

                    <p>No alt text provided for this image Starting business seems easy, register your business, make social media presence, work day and night, no proper plans no goals. The report says that 80% of business fails in first 2 years. Rest struggles, survives and becomes global brand. A famous mathematician says that “The business needs to execute 1000 days, which makes 1000 people to know the business which will be flourished in those 1000 days.”</p>

                      Business history shows that there was <Link className="font-[900] text-blue-600" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter">barter system</Link> in business where someone use to exchange rice with salt. Remembering before 50 years there was no Amazon, no UBER, no Apple and no Samsung. Everything was going on in simple way where business use to survive only. There was nothing called expansion in major people. The generation of technology reached in such boom that you can order anything from US by sitting any corner of the world.

                      Assuming bit earlier; there would be a man who thought people are ready to get delivery in any cost. A person may be dreaming Italian Ferrari being in China, a women thinking about American Rice Cooker from a far village in India. The company planned to deliver anywhere. The Amazon started their business by selling books online which now made Jeff Bezos world&apos;s greatest ecommerce gateway. The delivery system served to amazon and technology company serving them both by providing software, security, parcel tracking mobile application.

                      No alt text provided for this image It is not only Amazon has succeeded, the race has many great minds behind the great mind. Google & FlipKart duo are always ahead, UBER beating marketing, virgin ideas are rocking virgin minds. The first runner is far behind the fast runner.

                    <p>There are 4 major things in professional life, that&apos;s job, freelance, business & startup. Like everyone needs the best resume to get the best job; for every business & startup Business Model Canvas is necessary which functions like spinal cord of body.

</p>

<b>

</ul>

<p>At the starting Business Model Canvas makes feel like strange so the major thing is to understand it in very easy way. Business Model Canvas is rocket science for business. It doesn’t give financial projection, report, breakeven point but makes to meet all the goals and target. Starting from who can be a customer to how the business/ startup will function which has been crystalize to better understand how to start business or how to rescale business.

</p>

<p>The things are necessary to know major things by every entrepreneur, businessman and anyone who wants to leave the job and start anything in their own who thinks that freedom is everything in life which can give to work in free environment and make changes in lives & community.

  All about revenue streams :

</p>
                    <p>Business model Canvas’s 9th number or almost mentioned as goal mentions the financial profitability part. When someone starts business, there is a mistake of thinking that there is no doubt of being failure. All the way like roadmap “Business Model Canvas” plans everything from beginning to scaling business. A business needs to make a turn in the right way to drive their business in expressway. Amazon, Google, UBER, Hyperloop, Tesla are moving in expressway.

</p>

<p>No only technology, internet, social media also has turned them big but the things are doing the right thing in right time with right business modelling, planning and implementing to execute the best. The cream products of technologies are connectivity. Like a flight from Delhi to New York makes connectivity. UBER connects drivers with riders, Google connects with an information searcher by showing the results searching billion of pages from their database (big data).
