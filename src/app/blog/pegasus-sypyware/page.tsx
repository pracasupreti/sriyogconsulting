          Flashback of just two decades in Nepal, it was hard to see people
          carrying bar phones. The dream of people was not a smart phone but
          basic one. NOKIA, Ericsson, Sony etc were market leaders and the most
          important factor was basic connectivity, upgrading from pager. GSM
          network was not much penetrated and the phones which values USD 15 at
          current dates were much valued just for voice and text.
        </p>

        <p>
          A mixture of Pager and Landline, at that time was known as Cell phone
          or phone with mobility synonym as Mobile phone and till now most of
          the people still call it &quot;Mobile&quot; which uses cellular network and its
          full name is &quot;Mobile Phone or Cell Phone&quot;.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time increased and technology was emerging, the luxury phone became
          necessity day by day and it increased its presence. Till date, we
          have wide ranges of options to upgrade from basic bar phone with
          minimal features to high end, secured, sophisticated phones which are
          difficult to fit in the pocket.
        </p>

        <p>
          The evolution of mobile phone was for communication in early days but
          after 2010, mobile phones became smart phones and it became a
          necessity to have phone either for luxury or for showcasing. Bar
          phones are hardly seen in pockets. We are in such a generation where
          we have wrong belief that carrying a smart phone makes people smart
          or s/he is more valuable with brands such as iPhone, Samsung, OnePlus
          and hundreds more easily available in market packed with Android,
          iOS, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
          The more we upgraded from Voice and Text based phones with tons of
          apps widely available in market, the more risk we have. RAT is a
          system which can be easily installed in victim&apos;s laptop, desktop or
          even servers to get access to their screenshots, data, files and
          almost a person can operate the laptop/computer from any corner of
          the world with a basic system.

          Coming to the recent spyware surveillance named as &quot;Pegasus spyware,&quot;
          now smartphone users are aware that their end-to-end encryption is
          not fully encrypted or anyone can install spyware system in their
          mobile phones not only by sending links in WhatsApp but also the
          spyware was easily installed in phones with blank calls to victims
          phones from WhatsApp.
          <br />
          <br />
          &quot;As most people are aware, &apos;Telegram&apos;, &apos;Discord&apos;, &apos;Signal&apos; which are
          synonyms of the most secured chat applications are not secured.&quot;
          <br />
          <br />
          Android has basic limitations as compared to iOS for publishing apps
          in App Store. Blackberry was one of the best and secured systems
          which was managed by Research In Motion, a Canadian firm managing
          servers in Canada.

        <p>
          In many countries, Government itself made policy to remove Blackberry
          services and only handsets were used till few years back. Now in 2021
          it is very hard to find Blackberry (even without Blackberry
          services).

          Lots of messaging app providers have been struggling in market branding
          their app as secured, most secured, end-to-end encrypted which seems
          to have failed now. People named{" "}
          <span className="font-[800]">Pegasus</span> as spyware a few days back
          after knowing it was collecting data from various journalists,
          governments, politicians, bureaucrats etc. But till now many people
          are unaware of what WhatsApp, Viber, IMO, TikTok, ClubHouse, YouTube
          are collecting from their data.

          In this digital era, most everything is connected with internet, not
          only our laptops, desktops or smartphones but also cars, trains,
          microwaves and hundreds of devices connected to the internet which we
          call IoT.

          Nowadays, a device, social media, social messaging, a camera,
          Instagram, Viber or anything we use are like drugs, which change our
          habits. We are killing productive time which leads to a dark future
          and also helps to compromise data. The more apps you install, the more
          you are at risk.
